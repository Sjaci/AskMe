# AskMe : A minimal ChatBot
A ChatBot created with the help of LangChain and Gemini API.
This is a test project created as part of my learning on LangChain and LLM's.

## Pre-requisites
Make sure to have the following before starting:
1. Required Libraries: (will add them as I go)
     - python-dotenv (Using this library to secure my API Key; we can also use Colab Secrets or any other)
   ```
   pip3 install python-dotenv
   ```
     - langchain
   ```
   pip3 install langchain
   ```
     - Google Generative AI (to access the Genini's functions)
   ```
   pip3 install google-generativeai
   ```
2. API Key:
        After getting the API key from the Gemini API website, add them in a `.env` file.
   ```
   API_KEY=<ENTER_YOUR_API_KEY>
   ```
   
> [!CAUTION]
> Do not checkin the `.env` file or expose them to public as it has the API Key.
